A **Mancala** game. 

## Features
1. [X] Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery (7 days to completion)
2. [X] *You* against *another player* OR *you* against *the computer*. (3 days to completion)
3. [X] Take turns picking a number from your player side and shifting to the right, adding/leaving one in each adjacent pot (including your big pot). (4 days to completion)
4. [X] If your number is high enough to go around to your oponent's mini-pots, do so. (5 days to completion)

6. [X] When/if one player has no more filled mini-pots, the other player will have the total from all of their remaining mini pots added to their big pot! (6 days to completion)
7. [X] When all mini pots are empty, the player with the highest number in their big pot wins! (7 days to completion)

** I'm currently utilizing a grid for the board that will have responsive buttons for the players to click on. The amount each player has in their pots will be traked using math +=, ++ and -=, -- principles. Hopeful for a board image overlay to give the app more style an possibly 48 piece assets to correspond with the numerical gain and loss properties of the game

** Currently no installation requirements

** Unsolved problems to be updated when nearning completion of project
