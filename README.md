** I'm currently utilizing a grid for the board that will have responsive buttons for the players to click on. The amount each player has in their pots will be traked using math +=, ++ and -=, -- principles. Hopeful for a board image overlay to give the app more style an possibly 48 piece assets to correspond with the numerical gain and loss properties of the game

** Currently no installation requirements

** Unsolved problems to be updated when nearning completion of project
